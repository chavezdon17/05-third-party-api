Made a working work day scheduler.
Schueduler starts at 8 AM and ends at 5 PM.
the text block will change colors based on the current hour.
Grey is the past hour, red is the current hour, and blue is the furture hour.
The user can type a reminder in each time time block.
The user can make inputs on the text based on their schedule.
once user types an input they can save the input.
when the user reopens page the remider will still be there for the corresponding hour.
